# Python-Django-6
Project Description: Sinusitis Checker
Project Overview:

The Sinusitis Checker is a web application developed using Python and Django that helps users evaluate their sinus health based on their symptoms. The application provides a user-friendly interface where individuals can input their symptoms and receive an assessment of their condition, including the potential stage of sinusitis they may be experiencing.

Key Features:

Symptom Input: Users can select from a list of common symptoms associated with sinusitis, such as nasal congestion, facial pain, and headaches. The symptom selection process is streamlined to ensure ease of use.

Assessment Logic: Based on the user's selected symptoms, the application uses predefined rules and logic to determine the possible stage of sinusitis. The stages include acute, subacute, chronic, and recurrent sinusitis.

Results and Recommendations: After evaluating the symptoms, the application provides a result indicating the likely stage of sinusitis. It also offers general advice on managing symptoms and suggests when to seek professional medical consultation.

User Interface: The application features a clean, responsive design built with Django's templating system. Users can easily navigate through the symptom selection and view their results.

Data Management: Django’s ORM is used to manage and store user data, including symptom history and assessment results, allowing for future improvements and tracking of user interactions.

Technical Stack:

Backend: Python and Django for server-side logic, including symptom evaluation and result generation.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interface design and interaction.
Project Goals:

To provide an accessible tool for individuals to assess their sinus health.
To offer educational resources about sinusitis and its stages.
To encourage users to seek medical advice based on their symptoms and assessment results.
This project serves as a practical application of Django’s capabilities to build a health-related tool, demonstrating both its backend and frontend features.
